Building on the foundational theories discussed in previous videos, this lesson shifts focus towards practical application. We will walk you through several step-by-step examples that demonstrate how these theories are used in everyday situations. Each example is carefully selected to illustrate different aspects of the subject matter, showing you how to think critically and adapt the knowledge you've acquired to solve real problems. We will also discuss common mistakes that practitioners often make and how to avoid them. The goal of this video is to move beyond theory and into action, helping you gain the hands-on experience needed to excel in this field.
