00:08 Narrator: Hi I'm Neil. Thanks for joining
me on English at Work - a new series of programmes
00:13 set in an office, full of top tips to help you
00:16 learn some useful business language which you
00:19 could use in the workplace.
00:21 In the next few minutes you can join me on
an introductory tour around one of London's
00:26 biggest imitation plastic fruit manufacturers,
called Tip Top Trading. We're going to hear
00:34 from some of the employees that work so hard
to keep the business running smoothly.
00:39 So come on then! Let's step into the office
and eavesdrop on Tip Top Trading's possible
00:45 newest recruit. I say 'possible' because she is still being interviewed for the job of Sales Executive
00:56 Anna: Firstly, this job is an ideal match
for my skills and experience: I've spent
01:01 several years working in sales and I get on
with people easily. Well, I
01:07 mean, apart from the ones I don't like of
course! Secondly, I know Tip Top
01:12 Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies
in London, and I want to
01:16 be part of that.
01:17 Paul: That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading
is the fastest-growing company in
01:22 the plastic fruits sector.
01:24 Narrator: Well said, Anna! If she gets that
job I'm sure she'll be an asset to the company.
01:31 The decision is in the hands of Manager, Paul,
who we heard there. He's a nice guy really,
01:37 a little disorganised, but when things go
wrong he's got to take charge a bit like this
01:43 Paul: Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients
came in with serious
01:48 complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery
of imitation bananas that
01:53 were purple - not very convincing, and Mr
Lime ordered grapefruits, but
01:59 got pineapples. Tom!
02:01 Tom: Yeah, listen...
02:02 Paul: Were you responsible for these errors?
02:05 Tom: Well... yes, but -
02:07 Paul: Look, mistakes happen. But it seems
that Mrs Kumquat left our offices
02:12 even angrier than when she came in and she
says she will never use Tip
02:16 Top Trading again!
02:18 Tom: I tried my best.
02:20 Paul: Hmmm.
02:21 Narrator: Ah yes, Tom! I hadn't warned you
about Tom, one of the company's top Sales
02:27 Executives - he's good...
02:29 Tom: (on phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie!
So what's the latest, are we on?
02:34 ... but his interpersonal skills need working
on. Listen to this!
02:38 Tom: My computer has crashed. I've lost my
phone. And there's a big, BIG
02:45 problem with my timetable. I have two meetings
scheduled at the same
02:50 time with two extremely important clients.
I can't do them both at once!
02:56 See what I mean! Now, every office needs a
good office assistant - and Tip Top Trading
03:02 is no exception. It's got Denise, who's there to assist, organise and sometimes make the tea...
03:10 Denise: Oh sorry excuse me, here's your tea
03:14 Paul.
03:15 Paul: Thanks Denise.
03:17 Narrator: But goodness! She likes to talk...
03:20 Denise: Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do
that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost
03:25 had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind
of servant!
03:30 Narrator: That's Denise! I think we'll just
leave the office now and let them get on with
03:36 their work
03:37 So that's Tip Top Trading. There are plenty
of other people we'll meet along the way...
03:42 so go on, why don't you join me for English
at Work from bbclearningenglish.com. See ya!
