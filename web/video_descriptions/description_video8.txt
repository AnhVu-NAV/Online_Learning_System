This video serves as an essential review session, designed to help you consolidate the vast amount of information you’ve learned so far. We revisit the key concepts covered in earlier lessons, providing summaries and clarification where needed. The goal is to tie together all the ideas and techniques you’ve encountered, demonstrating how they interact and complement one another. Additionally, we provide further examples to solidify your understanding of how these concepts are applied in real-world contexts. By revisiting these topics, you’ll be better prepared for the more complex material to come, ensuring that no foundational knowledge is left unclear.
